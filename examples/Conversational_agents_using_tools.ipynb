    "# Conversational Agents using Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through how to build an end-to-end LLM application powered by Langchain and OpenAI models, with access to external tools. This is a common design pattern for building products with LLMs that require:\n",
    "- Access to proprietary information and APIs\n",
    "- Multi-step logical reasoning\n",
    "- Enhanced reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this cookbook you'll be able to create tailored LLM agents that use custom tools to solve user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langchain\n",
    "LangChain is a [framework](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) for developing applications powered by language models. Their framework enables you to build layered LLM-powered applications that are context-aware and able to interact dynamically with their environment as agents, leading to simplified code for you and a more dynamic user experience for your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do LLMs need to use Tools\n",
    "One of the most common challenges with LLMs is overcoming the lack of recency and specificity in their training data - answers can be out of date, and they are prone to hallucinations given the huge variety in their knowledge base. Tools are a great method of allowing an LLM to answer within a controlled context that draws on your existing knowledge bases and internal APIs - instead of trying to prompt engineer the LLM all the way to your intended answer, you allow it access to tools that it calls on dynamically for info, parses, and serves to customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example is Search, where rather than answering using stale training data your LLM can use a browser to source information and summarise the answer back. Tools can also work [together](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/examples/mrkl_chat.html), with a Search tool to return numbers and a Calculator to execute mathematical functions being one common example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow\n",
    "- **Setup:** Import packages, set any required variables and connect to a vector database.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent:** Build an agent that leverages a modified version of the [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) framework to do chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent with History:** Add the concept of memory so the LLM can draw on conversation context.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base:** Create a knowledge base of Stuff You Should Know podcast episodes that we can use as a tool.\n",
    "- **LLM Agent with Tools:** Extend the agent with access to two tools and test that it uses both to answer questions."

    "\n",
    "An [LLM agent](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_llm_agent.html) in Langchain has many configurable components, which are detailed in the Langchain documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll employ a few of the core concepts to make an agent who talks in the way we want, can use tools to answer questions, and uses the right base LLM to power the conversation.\n",
    "- **Prompt Template:** The input template to control the LLM's behaviour and how it accepts inputs and produces outputs - this is the brain that drives your application ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates.html)).\n",
    "- **Output Parser:** A method of parsing the output from the prompt. If the LLM produces output using certain headers, you can enable complex interactions where variables are generated by the LLM in their response and passed into the next step of the chain ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/output_parsers.html)).\n",
    "- **LLM Chain:** A Chain brings together a prompt template with an LLM that will execute it - in this case we'll be using ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` but this framework can be used with OpenAI completions models, or other LLMs entirely ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html)).\n",
    "- **Tool:** An external service that the LLM can use to retrieve information or execute commands should the user require it ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html)).\n",
    "- **Agent:** The glue that brings all of this together, an agent can call multiple LLM Chains, each with their own tools. Agents can be extended with your own logic to allow retries, error handling and any other methods you choose to add durability to your application ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Before using this cookbook with the Search tool you'll need to sign up on https://serpapi.com/ and generate an API key. Once you have it, store it in an environment variable named ```SERPAPI_API_KEY```"

Oh, wait, what is balancing a checkbook mean? Seriously? Yeah. Thank God for my wife. So another reason you might avoid a bank is philosophically. There may be a longstanding distrust of banks in your family that you don't want to put your money in, or you may just want to be like, you know what? I don't want to take part in this modern society. I want to kind of drop out a bit. And a really good first move is to shut your bank account down. That's a big statement. Oh, yeah, it is. But a lot of people that are underbanked and don't have accounts aren't there on purpose. It's not some philosophical statement. A lot of times it's simply because they are poor and they don't have a lot of alternatives. Yeah. And the other thing about not having a bank account, not only do you not have a bank account, you also are, like, basically just avoiding banks altogether. There's plenty of other things that banks offer, like loans and mortgage, lollipops, stuff like that. Yeah. Maybe some free nasty coffee. So when you don't have a banking account, that's like the most basic unit of the banking world. Right. If you don't have that, you obviously aren't going to be exposed to all these other things that can help. Things like build your credit history through like a revolving loan or a mortgage or a car loan or something like that that you can build up your credit for and ultimately save money. So when you don't have a bank account, for whatever reason, you are effectively out of the banking system. The problem is you can live parallel to the banking system outside of it, but it can be really dangerous, especially if you're just dealing with cash, because that cash has to stay somewhere, whether it's on you or in your mattress or in a coffee can in your backyard. You're exposed for having that readily available to anybody who finds it or comes into your house with a gun to get it. Yes.\n",

Most cases these days you have well, I don't know about most cases, but in many cases you have automatic deposits of your work checks. Sure. A lot of people pay their bills wirelessly, online, directly from their bank. You might have a student loan, you might have a car loan, you might have your house mortgage, you might pay your credit card bills. All this stuff is running through a bank, most likely. And you would think it's probably impossible to not have a bank account these days. And I would say pretty much all Americans have them. Not true. Well, pretty much all Americans do. Like 93% do. Yeah, but that's not all. No, it's true.\n",

      "Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Yeah. 7% of Americans do not have bank accounts. About 9 million people last year in 2015 did not have bank accounts. 9 million people is a lot of people. No, it really is. And apparently that's household sorry, not people. Yeah, right. You're that is a big distinction, too. And the FDIC said, man, that's the lowest since we've been tracking this by far. And someone said, well, how long have you been tracking this? They said, well, the last six years. Really? Yeah, which I'm like. Really? That's when they started tracking it, but apparently so 2009. So if you want another number, the 9 million American households don't have bank accounts at all, then there are 25 million households in addition to that. So that makes almost like 34 million households, which that's a substantial number at this point. Sure. The 25 million are what's called underbanked, meaning they may have a bank account, but they don't use the bank account. Yeah. They don't use it because they are probably afraid of overdraft fees. Or they have maybe a bank account that got grandfathered in so that they don't have to pay minimum amount fees. And who knows? There's all sorts of reasons for people to not use a bank account that they have, but probably cheap among them is overdressed, which you'll talk more about. Yeah. And the majority of these underbank people in the United States are poor, usually. A lot of times they're minorities, a lot of times they're less educated. And these communities, there's a few reasons why they may not want to use a bank one. Maybe they don't trust banks. And if you look in the history of the United States or certainly even we're just talking about the Wells Fargo scandal, when you see stuff like that on the news, it should be upsetting to everyone. But obviously if you're poor and you don't have a lot of money, that may scare you into not wanting to use a bank at all. Right? Yeah.\n",

      "Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Maybe at the time, I might be making it up. I seem to remember them saying that, and I was like, I don't want that. Just let the check bounce and I'll take it up with them. Yes. The way it was marketed, though, was like, hey, we value you. We want to make sure that you can pay all your bills. So if something happens and you're overdrafted we'll cover it. We're just going to charge you a fee. And it sounds good, but again, when you go from high to low and all of a sudden your overdraft fees go from one to four or five or however many, that's a huge problem. Well, and the people that are overdrafting and the people that are at least able to afford those fees. Exactly. So it's a disproportionate burden on the poor, which makes it, as a scam, one of the more evil scams around. Yes. It's just wrong, then the idea that if you open an account, you should not opt in for overdraft protection. And it's easy to say when you're talking about checks for, like you're writing a check for a Mountain Dew and some cheetos. Yeah, who cares if you're short for that? You can go without that. But when you're talking about your rent check or like an actual grocery bill or something like that, it sucks that you can't get that stuff. But it's better to have to put a couple of things back than to pay $35 for one $2 item that you went over by, right? Yeah, that's a good point. And this was in my case, too. This is also back in the day when you I mean, a lot of times it was a mystery how much you had in your account. Right. Like, you couldn't just get on your phone before you write the check and be like, oh, well, no, I don't have enough money to cover this. Yeah, because even if you balanced your checkbook, sometimes you forgot to carry the one, it wasn't always 100% accurate.\n",
