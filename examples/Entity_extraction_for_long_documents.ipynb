    "We often need GPT-3 to help us extract key figures, dates or other bits of important content from documents that are too big to fit into the context window. One approach for solving this is to chunk the document up and process each chunk separately, before combining into one list of answers. \n",

    "- We'll chunk up our document and process each chunk to pull any answers out\n",
