    "This notebook presents how to implement a Question Answering system with Langchain, Qdrant as a knowledge based and OpenAI embeddings. If you are not familiar with Qdrant, it's better to check out the [Getting_started_with_Qdrant_and_OpenAI.ipynb](Getting_started_with_Qdrant_and_OpenAI.ipynb) notebook.\n",

    "1. Calculating the embeddings with OpenAI API.\n",
    "2. Storing the embeddings in a local instance of Qdrant to build a knowledge base.\n",
    "3. Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.\n",
    "4. Using Qdrant to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection to find some context.\n",
    "5. Asking LLM to find the answer in a given context.\n",
